<h1 id="top">Sources, Source-Names &amp; Source-Lists</h1>

<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>

<p>Sources are the origin of events that are received by Lilith. The typical source identifier is the IP address
	of the machine sending the event. This would be "127.0.0.1" in case of your own computer.</p>

<h2 id="sourceNames">Source-Names</h2>

<p>It's possible to give a certain source a name, e.g. the source "127.0.0.1" would likely be named "localhost",
	using "View" =&gt; "Edit source name…".
	The shortcut for this functionality is *command*-B.<br/>
	Named sources are used in two places:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are shown in the title of a view window so it's easier to see where the events are originating from.
		Names better suited for this than simply ip addresses.
	</li>
	<li>
		The can be added to <a href="#sourceLists">source lists</a> which can then be used to either white- or
		black-list the receiving of
		events from that sources.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Named sources can be configured in <a href="prefs://Sources">Sources preferences</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="sourceLists">Source-Lists</h2>

<p>Source-Lists can be used to either white- or black-list on the contained sources.<br/>
	In case of white-listing, only events from sources <strong>contained</strong> in the selected source list are accepted.<br/>
	In case of black-listing, only events from sources <strong>not contained</strong> in the selected source list are
	accepted.<br/>
</p>

<p>This functionality is mostly useful if you constantly receive events from a large amount of different applications
	and
	would like to temporarily work with only a subset of these.</p>

<p>You could, for example, create a source list that contains only "127.0.0.1" and white-list on that source list
	to receive only events originating from your own computer.</p>

<p>
	Source lists can be configured in <a href="prefs://SourceLists">Source Lists preferences</a> while black- and
	whitelisting can be configured in <a href="prefs://SourceFiltering">Source Filtering preferences</a>.
