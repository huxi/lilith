<h1><a name="top">Known Problems</a></h1>

<ul>
	<li>Preferences dialog is obviously not finished right now :)</li>
	<li>The 'Send to' functionality isn't working as expected if the network infrastructure changes.
		It should work but doesn't. I think it's a JmDNS problem but I have to investigate further.
	</li>
	<li>The 'Edit groovy!' functionality is currently broken. Just don't use it.
		See <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-2790">GROOVY-2790</a> for more information.
	</li>
	<li>Copy to clipboard does not work in details view.
		This is a limitation of Flying Saucer that's used as XHTML renderer. This problem seems to be fixed in
		the next version of Flying Saucer but it hasn't been released yet.<br/>
		See <a href="https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=172">bug #172</a>.<br/>
		In the meantime, you can copy parts or all of the event using the context menu.
	</li>
	<li>'Copy event' was meant to copy the event as HTML but this is severely broken in Java.<br/>
		There's no workaround available but this will *probably* be fixed in JDK7.
		So for now, 'Copy event' copies the XHTML code as text...<br/>
		See <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6392086">bug #6392086</a>.
