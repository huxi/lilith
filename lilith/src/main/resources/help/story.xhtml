<h1><a name="top">The story of Lilith</a></h1>

<p> I finished a quick LogBACK compatibility hack for Chainsaw on 2007-05-19 and realized
	that it wouldn't do at all. It exploded under heavy load and would freeze our webapp in the process.
	I could fix this specific problem with another quick hack as an interim solution but Chainsaw would've
	required a *significant* amount of cleanup work.</p>

<p>So I decided to just do a fresh, clean and modern (JDK 1.5) implementation
	of a LogBACK Event Viewer instead.</p>

<p>The first functional but very limited prototype was released on 2007-06-25 and is under heavy production use
	ever since that point of time.</p>
