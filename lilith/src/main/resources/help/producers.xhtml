	<li>a standard LoggingEvent server socket on port 4560, as used by LogBACK.</li>
	<li>a standard AccessEvent server socket on port 4570, as used by LogBACK.</li>
	<li>a multiplex Lilith LoggingEvent server socket on ports 10000 (compressed)
		and 10001 (uncompressed).
	</li>
	<li>a multiplex AccessEvent server socket on ports 10010 (compressed)
		and 10011 (uncompressed).
	</li>
	<li>a multiplex Lilith LoggingEvent XML server socket on ports 10020 (compressed)
		and 10021 (uncompressed).
	</li>
	<li>a multiplex Lilith LoggingEvent XML server socket on ports 11000 that is using
		zero-delimited xml-events,
