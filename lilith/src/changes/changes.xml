                named/saved conditions. Similarly, selecting "Level>=" populates the combobox with the correct values
                from TRACE to ERROR. The comboboxes, both filter type selection and filter text, feature autocompletion
                of entered text.

			<action dev="jhux" type="fix">
				sulky: Made sure that TimeoutOutputStream-Watchdog-Thread is stopped under all

			<action dev="jhux" type="fix">
				sulky: Fixed a stupid problem that could result in a deadlock in Lilith
				internal log view.

			<action dev="jhux" type="add">
				Added documentation about "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space" problem
				and implemented LogbackShutdownServletContextListener for proper shut down of
				logback.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Implemented changed message formatting logic introduced in SLF4J 1.5.3.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Prepared for logback 0.9.10. This required changes to LoggingEvent and contained StackTraceElements.
				Serialized LoggingEvents are not compatible to previous version.

			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				New xml schema 1.1 to support logback 0.9.10 features, i.e. CodeLocation, Version and Exact.

				Made sure that every TimeoutOutputStream is *always* properly closed in the multiplex-appenders. This

				For the record: Do *NOT* use IOUtils.closeQuietly in multithreaded webapp code!!!

			<action dev="jhux" type="add">
				Implemented internal Lilith logging.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Removed some debug logs from SerializingFileBuffer so basic initialization is guaranteed to *not* emit
				any logging events.

			<action dev="jhux" type="fix">
				XML appenders are now sending the message pattern instead of the formatted message.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Removed shutdown hook from JmDNS. This fixes the shutdown deadlock but Lilith is still
				crashing badly on Mac OS X because of JmDNS problems.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Disabled bonjour by default because it's just too unstable :(
				Activate it using -b command line argument.

				Printing command line arguments if started verbose (-v).

			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Implemented own message formatting in MessageFormatter that does not rely on slf4j anymore.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="add">
				Added support for Exceptions in case of parameter array,
				i.e. log.debug("{} {}", new Object[]{"One", "Two", new Throwable()) will both
				evaluate the parameters in the message and the additional Throwable as the Throwable of the
				LoggingEvent.
				See http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70 .
				This was also reported as a Lilith bug by Alfred. :)
				This feature will only work if one of the Lilith appenders is used, not with
				the original ch.qos.logback.classic.net.SocketAppender.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				LoggingEvent.getMessage() does now return a lazily initialized formatted log message.
				There's no setMessage method anymore.
				Instead, there are set/getMessagePattern methods.
				All code in Lilith has been changed to not perform the message formatting manually
				but using getMessage instead.
				People that have not changed [user.home]/.lilith/detailsView/detailsView.groovy themselves
				should simply delete that file and restart Lilith. While this is not strictly necessary
				it will result in increased performance.

			<action dev="jhux" type="add">

			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Happy Birthday to Lilith!
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Added special handling of OutOfMemoryError handling to AbstractMessageBasedEventProducer. It now tries
				to skip the amount of bytes while logging a warning about the problem. The stream isn't closed anymore
				in that case. This might help if huge events are logged but Lilith does not have enough memory to
				receive them.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Reduced internal event buffer from 10.000 events to 1.000 events. This was done to make Lilith less
				memory hungry. It is still possible to run into OutOfMemoryErrors if unusually large events are received
				very fast.
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
				Added option to show source identifier even in case of named source. Default is on because it's really

				Add Preferences Toolbar-Button

				Yet another XML fix. See SimpleXml.replaceNonValidXMLCharacters for details.

				IDEA integration using Lilith IDEA Plugin. It's now possible to jump to the source of a logging event or

				quickly (i.e. just inside of the event dispatch thread) but will be enhanced later.
				It's working, though. :)

			<action dev="jhux" type="fix">
				Fixed sillyness in ZeroDelimitedXml[..]. The zero-byte is NOT added to the string anymore.
				Did I mention that I hate 'while' and 'do..while' loops and that 'for(;;)' is the only way to
				go instead?
			</action>
			<action dev="jhux" type="update">
